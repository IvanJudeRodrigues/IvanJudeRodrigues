Hi I am Ivan. I am an aspiring Data Scientist and Junior Python Programmer.I have recently completed a four month Bootcamp run by
Hyperiondev/CoGrammar and funded by The Department of Education. The course was free and covered basic Python programming and Data Science.
The deadline for completion was 31st March 2024.I am seeking a position as an apprentice or Junior Python rogrammer/Data Analyst.
I have made more than 100 applications but have had only one interview which was unsuccessful. I am making a career change at the age of 57.
I have a degree in Psychology and a Masters in Business IT over 20 years ago. Since graduating I could only find work in sales, unrelated 
directly to my qualifications.I find data science very interesting and can uncover alot of information and knowledge which will be benficial
to companies, individuals and society. Apart from the Bootcamp course I have no qualifications or work experience in Data Analysis or Python
programming.I have experience in over a dozen jobs in various sectors like motorbike courier/pizza delivery driver, cashier at M&S and as a
Security Officer. I am currently also a freelance Personality Psychologist but cannot make a living out of it.
